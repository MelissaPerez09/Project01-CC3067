# Project01-CC3067: XMPP-Based Instant Messaging Client
First project, Computer Networks course at Universidad del Valle de Guatemala. 

The main objective is to implement a client for instant messaging using the XMPP (eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol). The application was built using React with Vite for frontend and Javascript for backend.

It works through the server provided by the professors with the domain: `alumchat.lol`. So the server must be up and working, for the application to work properly.

```

## Usage
After following the installation steps, the application will be running locally. You can interact with the XMPP server to perform various messaging operations such as sending messages, managing contacts, and participating in group chats.

To register a new account or log in, use the provided forms in the application interface. All interactions with the XMPP server will be managed in real-time through the web client.
